== Description ==

<strong>Checkout Optimization for WooCommerce - Why replace your WooCommerce Checkout?</strong>

Stop losing sales to WooCommerce's clunky default checkout. CheckoutWC gives you a modern, Shopify-style checkout proven to boost conversions 20-35% based on real customer reports. With express payments (Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal), address autocomplete, instant validation, and mobile-first design

<strong>The best Shopify features with the best of WooCommerce ✅</strong>

Which do you think is easier: doubling your traffic or doubling your conversion rate from 1% to 2%? 🤔

The answer is probably obvious: it’s much easier and less expensive to fix a leaky checkout page than it is to double the number of people who visit your site. Lead generation is expensive!

### Highlights
- Beautiful <strong>multi-step</strong> checkout that guide customers smoothly through your store
- <strong>Express checkout</strong>: Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal - one-click checkout with supported gateways
- <strong>Mobile-first design</strong> that looks great on any device
- <strong>Smart validation & autocomplete</strong> (ZIP/postal → city/state, email domain suggestions)
- <strong>Cart & shipping optimizations<strong>:  only ask customers for the information you need, whether you're selling digital goods, subscriptions, or regular shipped products
- <strong>Customer conveniences</strong>: existing user detection, clear totals, sensible billing address controls
- <strong>Theme & gateway compatibility</strong>: works with popular WooCommerce themes and payment providers

CheckoutWC provides a modern, <strong>conversion-focused WooCommerce checkout</strong> that’s 100% responsive and easy to tailor to your site, no more page builders or funnel hacks required.
Here are the major benefits of optimizing your WooCommerce checkout with CheckoutWC:

<strong>Conversion-Optimized WooCommerce Checkout Template</strong>

Replace the default WooCommerce checkout with a beautiful multi-step template inspired by Shopify and built for higher conversions. Instead of a clunky, one-size-fits-all checkout that causes cart abandonment, you get a modern flow that guides customers through each step with clarity. Our merchants consistently see higher conversion rates simply by switching to CheckoutWC.

<strong>Express Checkout Options</strong>

Support for Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal gateways gives you a true express checkout experience. Customers can skip the form and complete their order in seconds, which dramatically reduces cart abandonment and improves mobile checkout performance. Express checkout is one of the easiest ways to increase revenue without changing your products or traffic.

<strong>Mobile-Friendly & One Page Checkout Ready</strong>

Every CheckoutWC template is 100% responsive and optimized for phones, tablets, and desktops. Whether you prefer a multi-step WooCommerce checkout or a single one page checkout flow, CheckoutWC makes it easy to give customers a faster, smoother experience on every device.

<strong>Smart Field Handling with Address Autocomplete</strong>

Stop losing sales to slow, error-prone forms. CheckoutWC includes instant field validation, email domain suggestions, and address autocomplete (zip → city/state). These features save time, reduce mistakes, and make the WooCommerce checkout process feel polished.

<strong>Cart & Shipping Optimizations</strong>

Fight cart abandonment with built-in checkout optimizations: skip the cart page entirely, skip shipping fields when not needed, hide optional fields, and collapse extra inputs. CheckoutWC Lite also makes sure sale prices and totals are displayed clearly, which increases trust and helps customers complete their purchase.

<strong>Customer-Friendly Experience Improvements</strong>

Detect existing users by email, simplify billing address handling, show mobile cart totals above the place order button, and make free orders frictionless by hiding unnecessary billing fields. These small touches create a checkout that feels intuitive and professional, which keeps customers coming back.

<strong>Works With Every Theme & Payment Gateway</strong>

CheckoutWC Lite is designed for broad compatibility. It works with all WooCommerce themes, all payment gateways, and popular extensions out of the box. No matter how your store is set up, CheckoutWC makes sure your WooCommerce checkout just works.

<strong>Developer-Friendly Tools</strong>

Need more control? CheckoutWC Lite includes options to add header and footer scripts or extend functionality with PHP snippets. Developers can easily customize the WooCommerce checkout experience without fighting against page builders or messy templates. Do what the WooCommerce block checkout won’t let you!

### Integrations

CheckoutWC works with major WooCommerce extensions including Subscriptions, Memberships, and Constellation by Kestrel.

It also integrates seamlessly with popular payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, Square, Authorize.net) and shipping plugins.

<strong>Conversion Optimizations</strong>

Express checkout gateway support for Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and Amazon Pay lets customers complete orders in seconds.

<strong>Side Cart for WooCommerce</strong>

Give your customers a faster, more seamless shopping experience with a modern, AJAX-powered WooCommerce Side Cart. Instead of forcing shoppers to reload pages or visit the cart separately, you can show live cart contents, quantities, totals, and shipping progress without interrupting the browsing flow. The side cart supports coupon entry, product variations, and inline quantity edits. You can also display free shipping goals and order bumps on the cart to increase your average order value.

<strong>Order Bumps & Upsells</strong>

Boost your average order value with native WooCommerce order bumps and upsells. Rule-based targeting by product, category, cart total, or coupon. Multiple placement options (above payment, below totals, inside the side cart), flexible layouts and skins, and support for variable products. Add post-purchase upsells and downsells with after-checkout modal offers or suggested product carousels.

<strong>Abandoned Cart Recovery</strong>

Recover lost sales automatically with built-in WooCommerce abandoned cart recovery. CheckoutWC captures customer emails early in the checkout process, allowing you to send automated reminders to shoppers who abandon their carts. Send personalized follow-ups with discounts, offers, or gentle nudges to complete the purchase. Simple to set up and proven to win back sales you thought were gone.

<strong>Compatibility & Developer Tools</strong>

CheckoutWC Pro works with WooCommerce Subscriptions, Memberships, Constellation by Kestrel, physical, digital, and mixed carts, plus local pickup and delivery flows. Translation-ready with multi-currency, RTL, and WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility compliance. Track your checkout funnel with Google Analytics 4, Facebook Pixel, TikTok, and built-in hooks. Developers get a visual action hooks guide, safe template overrides, and a full snippet library.

## Who Uses CheckoutWC?

<strong>CheckoutWC is built for any WooCommerce store that wants higher conversions and fewer abandoned carts.</strong>

Whether you sell physical products, digital downloads, or subscriptions, it gives you a faster, modern, conversion-optimized checkout that works with every WooCommerce theme and gateway.

### Perfect for:
- <strong>Store owners</strong> who want a Shopify-style WooCommerce checkout that looks professional and builds trust
- <strong>Agencies & freelancers</strong> managing multiple client stores at scale
- <strong>Course creators & membership sites</strong> using WooCommerce Subscriptions, WooCommerce Memberships, or Constellation
- <strong>Subscription & dropshipping businesses</strong> needing fast, mobile-friendly checkout flows
- <strong>Digital product sellers</strong> who want fewer failed orders and smoother repeat purchases
- <strong>Local businesses & pickup / delivery shops</strong> needing clear shipping and pickup options.

If you sell with <strong>WooCommerce</strong>, CheckoutWC works for you. No extra setup or ecosystem changes required.

## How to Improve Your WooCommerce Checkout Conversion Rate

Improving your WooCommerce checkout conversion rate starts with removing friction. Every extra field, confusing label, or slow-loading element creates hesitation, and hesitation kills sales.

<strong>CheckoutWC fixes this by replacing that one-page wall of fields with a guided, conversion-optimized flow.</strong> Customers move step-by-step through the process: first contact info, then shipping, then payment. Each section feels short and achievable, reducing anxiety and form fatigue. On mobile, this makes a dramatic difference—buyers see only what’s relevant at each stage and can complete a purchase with one thumb.

Express checkout options like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal eliminate typing altogether, while address autocomplete and instant validation prevent common form errors that cause failed orders. Built-in optimizations such as skipping unnecessary steps (like shipping on digital orders) and showing clear order totals reduce uncertainty, which builds trust and confidence.

In short, CheckoutWC transforms WooCommerce from a functional checkout into a <strong>sales engine</strong>—a checkout experience designed to convert visitors instead of losing them. When you remove friction and make the path to payment effortless, every bit of your marketing traffic becomes more valuable.

## External services ##

CheckoutWC optionally connects to the Google Fonts API to load web fonts for your checkout template.

- A request is sent to Google Fonts when you open <strong>CheckoutWC → Appearance → Design</strong> (to fetch available font options).
- On the checkout page, a request is only made if you’ve actively selected a Google font.

If you do not choose a Google font, <strong>no calls are made to Google</strong>. This service is provided by Google: Terms of Use, Privacy Policy.

## Why choose CheckoutWC by Kestrel?

<strong>CheckoutWC began inside a WooCommerce agency</strong> frustrated by the limitations of the default checkout. Every project meant wrestling with hooks, custom code, or expensive third-party plugins that never felt native to WordPress.

We built CheckoutWC as a <strong>purpose-made WooCommerce checkout plugin</strong> that combines the speed and clarity of Shopify’s checkout with the flexibility of WordPress. No complicated setup. No locked-down SaaS pricing. Just a drop-in upgrade that works with your store today.

Now, <strong>thousands of WooCommerce stores</strong> use CheckoutWC to reduce cart abandonment and improve conversions. It’s fast, intuitive, and built with store owners and agencies in mind.

<strong>A better WooCommerce checkout — fast, lightweight, and built to convert.</strong>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will it work with my theme and gateway? =

Yes. CheckoutWC is designed for universal compatibility with all WooCommerce themes. Unlike other checkout plugins that rely on specific theme structures, CheckoutWC uses a template-based system that works independently of your theme's design.

CheckoutWC supports all major payment gateways including Stripe, PayPal, Square, Authorize.net, and more. It also works with popular shipping providers and WooCommerce extensions. If it works with WooCommerce's default checkout, it will work with CheckoutWC

= Do I need Apple Pay/Google Pay for express checkout? =

You'll need a compatible payment gateway (such as Stripe or Square) and customers must use a supported browser and device. Once your gateway is configured, CheckoutWC automatically displays express payment buttons where appropriate. Apple Pay requires Safari or an Apple device, while Google Pay works across Chrome and Android devices.

= Can I use CheckoutWC with WooCommerce Blocks? =

CheckoutWC replaces the WooCommerce checkout page entirely, so it doesn't use the WooCommerce Blocks checkout system. However, CheckoutWC is fully compatible with other WooCommerce Blocks features throughout your site, including cart blocks, product blocks, mini cart, and filter blocks. The checkout experience itself uses CheckoutWC's optimized templates instead of blocks.

= Will CheckoutWC work with my shipping plugins? =

Yes. CheckoutWC works with all major WooCommerce shipping plugins including WooCommerce Shipping, ShipStation, Table Rate Shipping, Advanced Shipment Tracking, and more. Any shipping method that works with WooCommerce's default checkout will work seamlessly with CheckoutWC. The plugin displays shipping options the same way WooCommerce does, just in a more user-friendly layout.

= How do I upgrade from Lite to Pro? =

Purchase CheckoutWC Pro from <a href="https://www.checkoutwc.com">checkoutwc.com</a>, download the Pro version, and install it on your site (you can keep Lite installed or remove it). Your Lite settings are automatically preserved when you activate Pro. Enter your Pro license key in CheckoutWC → License to receive updates and unlock all Pro features. Your checkout continues working without interruption during the upgrade.

= Is it translation-ready and RTL-friendly? =

Yes. CheckoutWC is fully translation-ready and supports right-to-left (RTL) languages. We've bundled translations for many languages, and the plugin works with WPML, Polylang, and other translation plugins. If we don't have a translation for your language yet, let us know and we'll add it.

CheckoutWC is already translated into <a href="https://www.checkoutwc.com/documentation/localization/">over 20 languages</a>.

= Will it slow down my site? =

No. CheckoutWC templates are lightweight and optimized for performance. The plugin typically loads faster than WooCommerce's default checkout because it uses streamlined code and efficient rendering. We prioritize speed alongside conversion optimization.

= How do I enable address autocomplete? =

CheckoutWC Lite includes basic address autocomplete for ZIP/postal code that automatically fills city and state. Enable it in CheckoutWC settings. For full Google Maps address autocomplete (predictive address search as you type), upgrade to CheckoutWC Pro and configure your preferred provider in settings.

= How do I test the checkout safely? =

Use your payment gateway's test mode to process test transactions without charging real money. Test both guest checkout and logged-in checkout, verify coupons apply correctly, confirm shipping methods display properly, and check tax calculations. Always test on a staging site first before going live. If you have questions during testing, contact our support team for assistance.

= Where can developers customize templates? =

Developers can customize CheckoutWC using our visual hooks guide and snippet examples in our documentation. Add custom header and footer scripts through the settings panel, or use PHP snippets to extend functionality. Safe template overrides are supported for advanced customization. If you need a customization option that doesn't exist, let us know and we'll add it.

== Troubleshooting Common Issues ==

Having trouble with your <strong>WooCommerce checkout</strong>? Most <strong>CheckoutWC issues</strong> can be fixed quickly with these steps:

= Checkout page not loading or showing errors =

If your checkout page isn't loading properly, first update all your plugins to their latest versions. Many issues are resolved in updates. Next, check for plugin conflicts by deactivating all plugins except WooCommerce, CheckoutWC, your payment gateway, and shipping methods. If this fixes the problem, reactivate plugins one at a time to identify the conflict.

= Express payment buttons not showing =

Verify your payment gateway is configured with valid API keys and has express payments enabled in its settings. Remember that Apple Pay only appears on Safari or Apple devices, and Google Pay only shows on Chrome and Android devices. Check your browser's developer console (F12) for JavaScript errors that might prevent buttons from loading. Ensure you're using a compatible gateway like Stripe, Square, or PayPal Commerce Platform.

= Error: "Account username is a required field" =

This means WooCommerce is not configured to automatically generate usernames. Go to WooCommerce → Settings → Accounts & Privacy and enable the option to automatically generate usernames from customer emails

= Error: "We were unable to process your order, please try again" =

This indicates WooCommerce cannot verify checkout submits. Update WooCommerce to the latest version (requires WooCommerce 3.4 or higher). Clear your site cache after updating.

= Checkout page styling looks broken =

Clear your site cache and browser cache first. Check for JavaScript errors in your browser console (F12). If you're using a theme like Divi, Astra Pro, or Avada, there may be conflicting checkout styles. Try temporarily switching to a default WordPress theme (like Twenty Twenty-Four or Storefront) to confirm it's a theme conflict. Contact support with your theme name for specific compatibility guidance.

= Address autocomplete not working =

CheckoutWC Lite includes ZIP/postal code autocomplete that fills city and state automatically. This requires valid postal code data for your country. For Google Maps address autocomplete (predictive search as you type), you need CheckoutWC Pro with a valid Google Maps API key configured. If you're seeing "Google Maps error" messages on your checkout, check your browser console for API key errors and verify your API key is configured correctly with the Places API enabled.

= Changes to settings not appearing on checkout =

After changing CheckoutWC settings, clear all caches: your site cache plugin, CDN cache (like Cloudflare), and browser cache. Hard refresh your browser using Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac). Try viewing the checkout in incognito/private browsing mode to rule out browser caching issues.

= Server error messages (404, 500, 504 errors) =

404 errors indicate the AJAX endpoint cannot be found—usually a server configuration issue or permalink problem. Try resaving your permalinks in Settings → Permalinks. 500 errors indicate a PHP fatal error; check your error logs or enable WordPress debugging (WP_DEBUG) to see the specific error. 504 timeout errors indicate server performance problems unrelated to CheckoutWC—contact your hosting provider.

= Finding plugin conflicts quickly =

If you have many plugins installed, use a binary search method: deactivate half your plugins, test the checkout, then you'll know which half contains the problem. Keep dividing in half until you find the specific plugin causing issues. This is much faster than testing plugins one by one.

= Still having problems? =

Enable WordPress debugging (add define('WP_DEBUG', true); to wp-config.php) and check your error logs for specific error messages. Test on a staging site when possible. Contact CheckoutWC support with details about your active theme, plugins, and any error messages from the browser console or server logs.
